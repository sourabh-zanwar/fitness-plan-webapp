Following is my workout plan, I want you to extract the necessary information from each day for each section and present it in a tabular format in markdown. Always put the exercise names in the second column and make it separately for each day along with serial number. Make sure that you include all exercises including warmup, cool down, core, cardio, etc as part of the tables.
